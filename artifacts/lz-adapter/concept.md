 # LayerZero Bridge Adapter

The Portal contract is M0 crosschain bridge interface that supports arbitrary messaging networks via implementing BridgeAdapter contracts for those networks. The Portal defines its own payload encoding and uses simple generic messages on these networks. Currently, it supports messages on Hyperlane and Wormhole. I would like to add support for LayerZero's network as another option. To do this, I would like to build a bridge adapter that implements LayerZero's OApp standard, details can be found here: https://docs.layerzero.network/v2/developers/evm/oapp/overview. The adapter should have parity with the existing bridge adapters.

Some common bugs in crosschain messaging systems happen when the receiving contract does not verify the sender of the message or when the messages are not protected from replays on different chains. Different messaging networks handle this in different ways, some do it for you, others require you to implement checks. We need to make sure these checks are included either in the LayerZero core codebase that is inherited or our own. Another important differences is that some crosschain messaging networks refund the sender any excess bridge fees on the origin (source) chain and others refund them on the destination chain. The Portal contract supports both methods, but the adapter should specify where the refund will be received based on the network where relevant.
